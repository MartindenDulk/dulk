# _dulk - an Perl IRC bot_
Description: The idea was to create an IRC Bot from scratch with Perl. dulk uses IO::Socket as the fundament for the connection and the plan is to create everything around it ourselves.

## Todo
- Auto-reconnect on d/c
- Register plugin commands to be able to show a help text with the commands
