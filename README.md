# _dulk - an Perl IRC bot_
Description: The idea was to create an IRC Bot from scratch with Perl. dulk uses IO::Socket as the fundament for the connection and the plan is to create everything around it ourselves.

## Todo
- Module for incoming messages. Make it so you don't have to mess with the input in the main .pl script
- Module for authing the bot with various IRC network services
- Create Database Handler
- Register function for commands
-- Make it so that a small help text can be stored and viewed with an command/web interface
